## Decriptions
 All files are reasonably organized and have comments within them breaking up sections and stating what is what. Many of the functions that were
written use array methods and target the DOM as that was the easiest way I though to do it. While everything is not completley uniform it gets
the job done.

 ### Basics.js
 This file contains the Bold, Underline, Italics, Strikethrough, and Superscript functions. All of them use basic Array methods but some of them
 have become deprecated and may not function on some browsers. Where the array methods were not compatible with the browser I was testing on at the 
 time I used HTML inputs and that worked just fine.
